# Belly-Button-Challenge  
  
This project seeks to provide an interactive interface for exploring a dataset that catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels, the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.  
  
The static folder contains the "app.js" JavaScript file, which will retrieve the dataset and then create a bar graph and a bubble chart using Plotly, visualising the samples in the chosen subject's belly button. Additional demographic information regarding the currently selected subject will be shown in a panel to the side. To view the data of a different subject, simply select a different subject from the dropdown menu, the panel info and visualisations will be updated automatically.  
  
The dataset is also provided as a .json file in the main directory (samples.json).
